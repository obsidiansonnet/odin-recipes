- **Project Summary:** This project is part of The Odin Project, a full stack development curriculum. This project involved making a basic HTML only website featuring three recipe pages and a home page. The purpose of this project is to serve as a practical exercise to apply the knowledge of working with Command Line (WSL), Git and GitHub workflow, and HTML Foundations.  

- **Key Features:** As outlined above, the website includes four pages, a home page and three recipe pages. The recipe pages contain link back to the home page and the home page provides links to the three recipe pages in an unordered list format. The recipe pages contain Creative Commons licensed images with appropriate attributions, and sections describing the recipe, listing ingredients, and outlining the making process.   

- **Technologies And Tools Used:** This website has been built using only HTML, and the tools used to make, maintain, and publish this website are Command Line (WSL), VS Code (code editor), Git (Version Control), GitHub (Remote Repository), and GitHub's feature that allows publishing web projects from public repositories.             

- **What I learned:** 
    - This project provided a good practice of Command Line (WSL) as it required creation of directories and files and performing other file management tasks.
    
    - This project helped me cement the structure of an HTML page and the use of various HTML elements (semantically, where applicable), attributes, and their values covered in the lessons leading up to this project. These include the elements and attributes of the boilerplate code; anchor tag and various attributes and values used with it, such as href, rel, target, noopener, noreferrer; tags used to present text such as headings, paragraph, strong, emphasis, unordered and ordered lists, and list item; image element and its attributes such as alt, width, height; and elements used to present image credits, such as figure and figcaption.      

    - While the curriculum page for this project provided step by step instructions in good detail, I gained a practical understanding of one way to approach a project by breaking it down in small chunks. The detailed instructions provided on the project page also helped me learn how to think about atomic commits, and and making frequent commits solidified the process of making commits, writing commit messages, and pushing the code to GitHub.
