                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Dry Gobi Manchurian is a popular Indo-Chinese appetizer made with crispy batter-fried cauliflower florets tossed in a flavorful mix of garlic, chilies, soy sauce, and spices. It's a street food favorite that's spicy, tangy, and perfect as a snack or starter. Unlike the gravy version, the dry style has no sauce base. The fried cauliflower is coated just enough to give a glossy finish, while keeping the florets crisp and crunchy.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 medium cauliflower (cut into small florets)</li>
